			Well, I consider myself a lucky and accidental engineer. I didnt
			inherently have an interest/knack for programming & didnt even feel
			comfortable using the computer. However, in the third semester of my
			diploma, I had the privilege of meeting an amazing professor who
			taught us C language, and things took a turn for good. Her teaching
			style sparked a passion and deep interest for coding that I have
			never regretted since.

			Apart from coding, my other interests include music, playing the
			guitarðŸŽ¸, reading books on entrepreneurship and reading biographies
			of entrepreneurs. I can solve 2 types of Rubik's cube(that too
			within a minuteðŸ¤“). Love all things Hollywood, be it Netflix
			original series, Marvel superhero movies, or some documentary. A
			keen follower of Simon Sinek's Infinite MindsetðŸ”†.

			Overall, I believe that my unique journey has given me a unique
			perspective that I can bring to any new challenges that come my way.
			I am excited to see what the future holds and eager to contribute my
			skills and expertise to any organization that values creativity,
			hard work, and a thoughtful approach to problem-solving.
